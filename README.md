# Computer Graphics Projects

This repository contains three C programs that use the `graphics.h` library to create simple graphical applications. Each program is written in C and demonstrates different graphical features:

1. **Hangman Game:**

   - File: `hangman.c`
   - Description: This program is a text-based hangman game. It allows the user to guess a word and displays a hangman figure as incorrect guesses are made.

2. **Solar System Simulation:**

   - File: `solar_system.c`
   - Description: This program simulates a basic model of the solar system with the sun and planets orbiting around it. The positions and sizes of the planets are not to scale but provide a visual representation of the solar system.

3. **Analog Clock:**
   - File: `clock.c`
   - Description: This program displays an analog clock with three clock hands for hours, minutes, and seconds. The clock continuously updates to show the current time.
